# Python in ArcGIS

This workshop is designed for participants taking the Python in ArcGIS workshops, but available to anyone. Participants will gain foundational knowledge of Python scripting for 
geospatial analysis and automation, enabling them to enhance their GIS workflows and gain confidence with the Python programming language. This workshop also introduces two powerful tools
from Esri's ecosystem: **ArcPy**, the Python library that powers ArcGIS Pro, and the **ArcGIS API for Python**, designed for working with WebGIS platforms like ArcGIS Online and ArcGIS Enterprise.

# Learning Outcomes
- Understand the basics of Python and geospatial developer tools
- Understand the basics of ArcPy
- Understand the basics of ArcGIS API for Python
- Develop and run Python scripts for geospatial workflows
